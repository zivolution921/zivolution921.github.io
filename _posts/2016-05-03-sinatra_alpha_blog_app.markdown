The process of building Sinatra App was very challanging to plan logically the interaction between the Users and Posts. Each User has many posts and the Posts belongs to the User. I also made User account with Sign up page and Sign in with validations that would raise errors if the user title is too short or description is too short. I really enjoyed the process of debugging and thinking logically how to create a blog from scratch.
