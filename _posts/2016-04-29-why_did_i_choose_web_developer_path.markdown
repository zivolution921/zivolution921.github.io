                                                                                                    To succeed in life, one must first fail. Passing through a point that seems impossible is the key to achieving success. People set their own limits. 
Coding for me is feeling limitless combining imgination and logic. My journey began when I had an idea to develop fitness app, where I did not know where to begin. I began self-teaching and researching about most updated technologies, learning HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript by combining functionality, interaction and form to design for fitting user experiences. 
  I decided to look for a bootcamp to enhance my knowledge and learn Ruby so I join Learn Verified program because it has great support from the instructors and it is affordable.
  The best way to accomplish your goals is by finding a “dream”, vision that dream, and make it into reality. With alot of hardwork, not sleeping many nights, building small projects, and prototyping my own ideas I finally learned the foundations and I am able to build a website from scaratch. 
Challenging yourself is the best way to know your limits and make a progress in life. One should never be afraid to challenge one’s self to “the edge”. I made a commitment to be a Web Developer, and to keep learning new techonologies for the rest of my life. When it comes to code, I do whatever it takes to find the right syntax and continue building until it becomes a 100% working app.
